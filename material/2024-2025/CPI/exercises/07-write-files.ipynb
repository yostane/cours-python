Create a program that asks the user to enter a word, if the entered value is \"quit\" then the program should stop otherwise the program adds the word into a list and asks the user to enter again another word and applies the same rule as the first word (\"quit\" means to stop otherwise add to a list and continue). When the program end (when the user types \"quit\") the program should write the content of the list into a file where each word is in a spearate line."
